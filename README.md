## 🎯 Project Overview
This interactive dashboard analyzes the **socioeconomic fabric of the French-Swiss border** (2015-2019). Using granular INSEE Filosofi data, it tests the hypothesis of the **"Geneva Gravity"**—the idea that the massive salaries of Geneva create a "Wealth Cliff" that distorts local housing markets and segregates populations by age and income.

### 🔍 Key Findings (The 3 Laws)
Our data analysis reveals three structural forces shaping the territory:
1.  **Law #1: Distance Decay (The Wealth Cliff)**
    *   *Observation:* Income levels collapse by **50%** once you move >15km from the border.
    *   *Result:* A distinct "Frontalier Elite" belt vs. a rural periphery.
2.  **Law #2: Poverty Displacement (The Iron Curtain)**
    *   *Observation:* A strong **-0.65 correlation** between Wealth and Poverty.
    *   *Result:* High housing prices in the border zone effectively "filter out" low-income residents.
3.  **Law #3: The Demographic Lever (Housing = Youth)**
    *   *Observation:* A **+0.40 correlation** between New Housing and Youth population.
    *   *Result:* The only way to attract young families is to build; existing housing stock is aging rapidly.

## 💻 Dashboard Features
*   **🌍 Interactive 3D Map:** Explore the "topography of wealth" with a tiltable, extrudable map of all communes.
*   **� Pinpoint Analysis:** Filter the map to highlight specific communes (e.g., Sauverny, Archamps) and see their specific metrics.
*   **📈 Time-Series Trends:** Track the evolution of income, poverty, and housing from 2015 to 2019.
*   **� Dist-to-Geneva Calculator:** Automatic calculation of every commune's distance to the Swiss economic center.
*   **📊 Correlation Matrix:** A real-time "Truth Table" showing how variables (Social Housing, Income, Age) interact.

## � Project Structure
Key files ensuring reproducibility and clean architecture:
*   `utils/constants.py`: Centralized configuration (URLs, metrics, year definitions) to avoid "magic numbers".
*   `scripts/download_data.py`: Intelligent script that fetches data from INSEE/GitHub, handling caching and format conversion automatically.
*   `Makefile`: Simple command interface for installation and execution.
*   `.devcontainer/`: Configuration for VS Code Dev Containers (Docker-based environment).

## �🛠️ Technical Stack
*   **Core:** Python 3.9+, Streamlit
*   **Data Processing:** Pandas, GeoPandas, Shapely
*   **Visualization:** Plotly Express, PyDeck (3D Maps), Folium
*   **Data Source:** [INSEE Filosofi (2015-2019)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/revenus-pauvrete-et-niveau-de-vie-donnees-carroyees/) & [France-GeoJSON](https://github.com/gregoiredavid/france-geojson) (Communes)
*   **Environment:** Includes `.devcontainer` and `Makefile` for full reproducibility.

## 🚀 Local Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Harish-Arvind/Data-Visualization-Geneva-effect-Streamlit-Project.git
    cd Data-Visualization-Geneva-effect-Streamlit-Project
    ```

2.  **Setup Environment & Data:**
    This project uses a **Makefile** for easy setup. This command will install dependencies and automatically download the required data (INSEE & GeoJSON) for you.
    ```bash
    make install
    make download
    ```
    *(Note: Data is downloaded from official INSEE sources and GitHub. The script automatically handles extraction and conversion.)*

3.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
    *Or manually: `streamlit run app.py`*
